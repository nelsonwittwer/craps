# What Am I?

This is a small project I build to test the viability of a craps
strategy.

If you place a $5 bet on the field and lose it, you double your bet and
add five. If you lose that bet, you double your previous and add 5. I
wanted to see how long I could run with that strategy before I lost my
money.

No matter what, you will end up losing it all with this strategy unless
you pick a stopping point. If I start with $150 and want to make $1000 I
will have a %57 chance of getting my number
